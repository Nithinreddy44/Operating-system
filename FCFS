For your test case, you can input the following values:

No of tracks: 5
Track position: 55 58 60 70 18
This will give you the following output:

Enter number of tracks: 5
Enter track positions: 55 58 60 70 18
The sequence of tracks visited is: 55 58 60 70 18 
The total head movement is 119 
The average head movement is 23.80
